# COVID-19 Projections

This repository contains Covid models implemented by Jataware.

Make sure you have Julia installed. It's generally better to use the binary
distributed by the developers because the ones built by the different
OS package repositories don't work so well.

## List of models
- Compartmentalized Model ([README](./compartmentalized_model/README.md)): Install
  by running `./compartmentalized_model/build.jl compt_model_install_dir`
